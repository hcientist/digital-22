  <h2>Elizabeth Feinler</h2>
  <p>"...from 1972-1989 she was a director of the network information systems centre at the Stanford research institute.
    The
    institute oversaw internet addresses and if you wanted a domain, you would have to go to Elizabeth. The network
    information centre was like the prehistoric google and by the late 1980s, the community had moved to the domain name
    system which helped lay the foundation for the modern internet. Elizabeth is well known for being one of the famous
    women in technology for helping the Stanford research institute transition to the domain name system and introducing
    the domain name protocol, she‚Äôs the one to thank for the dot coms, dot nets and dot govs used daily." (source: <a

  <h2>Radia Perlman</h2>
  <p>"Sometimes called the 'mother of the Internet,' a title she rejects, Radia Perlman is an American computer
    programmer and network engineer born in 1951. As one of the most influential women in computer science, she still
    works in the field as of 2022.</p>

  <p>Her important contributions to computer science include spanning tree protocol, a technology that changed the way
    networks communicate with each other. Perlman also wrote two computer science textbooks and taught at the University
    of Washington and Harvard University. She has received more than 80 patents throughout her career. (source: <a
